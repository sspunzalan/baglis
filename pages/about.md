# About Baglis

Baglis is digital collection containing local animated films, series, and comics of the Philippines. This was created in partial fulfillment of the course CWTS 2 SLIS under Professor Paul Jauson Perez.

With the digital collection, we aim to promote the creativity and skill in the animation and comics industry of the Philippines by showcasing these works across the years.
